# Winemap Project

Welcome to the Winemap project! This initiative provides a comprehensive map of wineries and vineyards, offering detailed information about each location. The project is based on research from [Eurac Research](https://www.eurac.edu/) and includes insights from the following publications:

- Candiago, S., Tscholl, S., Bassani, L. et al. A geospatial inventory of regulatory information for wine protected designations of origin in Europe. Sci Data 9, 394 (2022). https://doi.org/10.1038/s41597-022-01513-0

## Introduction

The Winemap project is designed to help wine enthusiasts discover and learn about wineries and vineyards. It provides an interactive map with detailed information about each location, including contact details, types of wines produced, and visitor information. Additionally, the project assesses the vulnerability of Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) regions to climate change. This assessment includes factors such as exposure to climate change, sensitivity to impacts, and adaptive capacity. By understanding these vulnerabilities, the project aims to guide efforts to enhance resilience and reduce negative impacts of climate change on these regions.

## Features

- Interactive map with winery and vineyard locations
- Detailed information about each location
- Search and filter functionality
- Assessment of PDO region vulnerability to climate change
